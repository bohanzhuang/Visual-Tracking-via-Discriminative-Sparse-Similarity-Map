```


## Code
```
The code runs on Windows with MATLAB 2012b.

***The main tracking function is in test.m and the parameters related to image sequences are set in setTrackParam.m. Detailed explanations can be found in each file.***

The results are slightly sensitive to affine parameters. You may obtain better results by adjusting the parameters.
